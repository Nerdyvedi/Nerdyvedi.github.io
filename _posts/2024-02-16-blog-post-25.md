How Do Different Kinds of load balancer work, and How do they route requests?

# A Comprehensive Comparison of Load Balancers: ALB vs. NLB vs. GLB vs. ELB

Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or resources to optimize performance, enhance reliability, and ensure high availability. The 3 prominent ones stand out: ALB, NLB, and ELB. Let's dive into the nuances of each to understand their strengths and ideal use cases.

## ALB (Application Load Balancer)

**Overview:** ALB operates at Layer 7 of the OSI model, offering advanced routing capabilities and content-based routing. It is tailored for modern applications running in containers or microservices architectures.

**Key Features:**
- **Path-Based Routing:** ALB can route traffic based on the URL path of the incoming request, allowing for efficient routing to different backend services.
- **Host-Based Routing:** Traffic can be directed to different backend servers based on the host header of the incoming request.
- **Support for WebSocket:** ALB seamlessly handles WebSocket traffic, making it suitable for real-time applications.

**Ideal Use Cases:** ALB works in scenarios where flexible routing and support for modern application architectures are required, such as microservices-based applications and containerized environments.

## NLB (Network Load Balancer)

**Overview:** NLB operates at Layer 4 of the OSI model, providing high-performance, low-latency load balancing for TCP and UDP traffic. It is designed for extreme performance and scalability.

**Key Features:**
- **Ultra-Low Latency:** NLB offers sub-millisecond latency and can handle millions of requests per second, making it ideal for latency-sensitive applications.
- **Static IP Addresses:** Each NLB instance is associated with a static IP address, simplifying DNS management and providing a stable endpoint for clients.

**Ideal Use Cases:** NLB excels in scenarios requiring high throughput, low latency, and scalability, such as high-traffic websites, gaming applications, and IoT platforms.


## ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)

**Overview:** ELB is a legacy load balancing service provided by AWS, encompassing both Classic Load Balancer and Application Load Balancer (ALB). While still widely used, its functionality is gradually being superseded by ALB and NLB.

**Key Features:**
- **Auto Scaling Integration:** ELB seamlessly integrates with AWS Auto Scaling, allowing for automatic adjustment of load balancer capacity based on traffic patterns.
- **Integrated Monitoring:** ELB provides comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, facilitating performance analysis and troubleshooting.

**Ideal Use Cases:** ELB remains a viable option for legacy applications and workloads running on AWS, although newer applications may benefit from the enhanced features and performance of ALB or NLB.

## Conclusion

In summary, the choice of load balancer depends on various factors such as application architecture, performance requirements, scalability needs, and geographic distribution. ALB, NLB, GLB, and ELB each offer unique features and capabilities tailored to different use cases. By understanding their strengths and limitations, organizations can select the most suitable load balancing solution to optimize the performance, reliability, and availability of their applications.
