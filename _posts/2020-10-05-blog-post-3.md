In this article we will find out what StyleGAN does, how it works, why it works.

WHAT IT DOES?
Input to the model is a latent code.
Latent means hidden. Best definition of latent space would be compressed data. 
StyleGAN generator maps a latent code to a high resolution realistic images. With some of the changes to the generator architecture, they were able to disentagle the latent space.
There is an unavoidable entaglement , as latent space follows the probability space of training data. 

Let us say, Our training dataset has all females wearing glasses. The latent space would learn this, and there would be an entanglement between these two , even though in reality there is no relation whatsoever with gender and glasses.

This entaglement is avoided embedding the latent code to an intermediate latent sapce.


WHAT IS DIFFERENT?
Traditionally, latent code is provided to the generator through the first layer of the network. In this model, the input to the generator is a constant.

Few StyleGAN applications can be listed as follows :
1. Style Mixing
   Can be used to mix styles of 2 images.
