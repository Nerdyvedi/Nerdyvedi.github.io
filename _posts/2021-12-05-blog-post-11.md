This blog explains my decision to quit Zomato and joining Amazon Cambridge.

Introduction
======
This term was mentioned in the [Batch Normalization paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167).
The author's described it in the following way
*We define Internal Covariate Shift as the change in the distribution of network activations due to the change in network parameters during training*

In a neural network, The output of the first layer feeds into the second layer , output of second feeds into third and so on. When the parameters of layers change, so does the distribution of input to subsequent layers.

Covariate shift refers to change in input distribution to a learning system.
Now, a change in input to the first layer of the model, gets amplified to subsequent layers, Hence even a small change in input distribution of the entire model 
can result in a large change in input distribution of deeper layers.
